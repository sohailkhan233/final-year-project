DDoS Attack Detection on CICIDS2017 — End-to-End ML/DL Pipeline (Google Colab)
=============================================================================

Overview
--------
This repository hosts a single Google Colab notebook that implements an end‑to‑end pipeline for **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection** using the **CICIDS2017** dataset (Friday WorkingHours Afternoon subset). The workflow covers data import, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (traditional ML and deep learning), evaluation, and result visualization.

Notebook
--------
- **Topic_1_MODEL_Complete.ipynb** — a complete, top‑to‑bottom, reproducible pipeline. Run it in Google Colab for the smoothest experience.

What the Notebook Does
----------------------
1. **Data Ingestion & EDA**
   - Loads CICIDS2017 CSV(s), inspects schema, checks missing values, and shows class distribution.
   - Visualizations: correlation heatmap, distributions for key features, and pairwise relationships for selected variables.
2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
   - Cleans/filters columns (drops IDs/timestamps if needed), handles missing values, converts categorical to numeric (if any).
   - Standardizes/normalizes numeric features where appropriate.
3. **Train/Test Split & (Optional) Cross‑Validation**
   - Fixed `train_test_split` for final report reproducibility.
   - K‑fold cross‑validation to assess generalization (optional cell).
4. **Models Trained**
   - Traditional ML: **Logistic Regression, K‑Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest**.
   - Deep Learning: **LSTM, GRU, CNN** (depending on activated cells).
5. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1‑score, ROC‑AUC**.
   - Visualizations: Confusion matrices, ROC curves; (optional) PR curves.
6. **Model Selection**
   - Compares all models across metrics and picks the best model for DDoS detection on the chosen subset.
   - (From project notes) **GRU** is the current top performer; please insert your final numbers in the section below.

Dataset
-------
- **Source**: CICIDS2017 (Friday WorkingHours Afternoon DDoS subset).
- **Target**: Binary label (e.g., *Benign* vs *DDoS*).
- **Features**: Network traffic statistics (flows/packets/bytes/time‑based). The exact set depends on the CSV used.
- **Path Assumption**: In Colab, upload the CSV(s) when prompted or mount Drive and update the path in the first data‑load cell.
  - Example (Colab upload): place file at `/content/Friday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-DDos.pcap_ISCX.csv` and keep the default path in the notebook, OR edit the path to your own.

Quick Start (Colab)
-------------------
1. Open **Topic_1_MODEL_Complete.ipynb** in Google Colab.
2. Run the first setup cells (they install/import required packages).
3. Upload your dataset file(s) when prompted **or** mount Google Drive and adjust the file path in the data‑load cell.
4. Go to **Runtime → Run all**. Review metrics and plots at the end.

Quick Start (Local Jupyter)
---------------------------
1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install the Python requirements listed below.
3. Open the notebook with Jupyter Lab/Notebook and update the dataset path(s).
4. Run all cells in order.

Requirements
------------
The notebook targets Google Colab (packages largely pre‑installed). For local runs, install:
- Python 3.10+
- `pandas >= 1.5`
- `numpy >= 1.23`
- `scikit-learn >= 1.3`
- `matplotlib >= 3.7`
- `seaborn >= 0.12`
- `imbalanced-learn >= 0.12`   # if you enable SMOTE/Resampling cells
- Deep learning backend (choose one based on the notebook cells you enable):
  - `tensorflow >= 2.12` **or**
  - `torch >= 2.1` and `torchvision` (if the PyTorch version of DL cells are used)

Example (local):
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn tensorflow
# or, if using PyTorch instead of TensorFlow:
# pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Reproducibility
---------------
- Fixed random seeds (e.g., `random_state=42`) where applicable.
- Fixed `test_size` in `train_test_split`.
- Optional K‑fold CV for robustness (shuffle + fixed seed).

Results (Fill with Your Final Numbers)
--------------------------------------
> Replace the placeholders below with the metrics produced by your final run.

- **Best Model**: GRU (current)  
- **Test Accuracy**: `XX.XX%`  
- **Precision / Recall / F1**: `P=0.XX / R=0.XX / F1=0.XX`  
- **ROC‑AUC**: `0.XX`  
- **Cross‑Validation (k=5)**: `mean ± std accuracy = XX.XX% ± X.XX%`  

> Tip: Keep raw CSV results/figures generated by the notebook in a `/results/` folder in this repo if you export them.
